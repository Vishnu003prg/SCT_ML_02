CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION USING KMEANS CLUSTERING

This is Task 02 of my project, completed as part of my internship at Skillcraft Technology Company.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

This project focuses on segmenting retail store customers based on their purchasing behavior using the K-means clustering algorithm. To analyze customer behavior, we consider key features such as annual income and spending score, and group the customers into distinct clusters that represent different purchasing patterns.

The goal of this project is to help businesses make informed marketing and customer service decisions by understanding customer segments more effectively.
